# smf-crate

A Clojure library designed to work with pallet to create an smf file.  It is specifically used with smartos but hopefully will work for other Solaris based OSes as well.  It is inspired by manifold.

## Continuous Integration Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstradling/smf-crate.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rstradling/smf-crate])

## Usage
Artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/strad/smf-crate.  If you are using Maven, add the following definition to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<repository>
 <id>clojuars.org</id>
 <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>

```

To run the live-test sample you will need to do the following...
* Create a local smartos image where root can log in to it.
* Update your ~/pallet/config.clj to have the 
```clojure
{:datacenter {:provider "node-list"
	:node-list [["<machine-name>" "smartos-testing" "<ip address> :smartos]]
        }
}
```
run the tests by typing in 
```bash
lein with-profile live-test test :live-test
```
